EquipmentDescriptions[0][0]=The Pulse Laser is the weakest weapon available. It's small size allows only enough energy to build up to emit pulses of light.
EquipmentDescriptions[0][1]=The Beam Laser is larger than the Pulse Laser, so can build up enough charge to power what are essentially two Pulse Lasers. The resulting effect appears more like a ant beam.
EquipmentDescriptions[0][2]=The Military Laser is the largest commercially available weapon. It can build up enough charge to power three Pulse Lasers in series, resulting in a more dense and concentrated beam.
EquipmentDescriptions[0][3]=Morgan's Laser has been constructed from a Beam Laser, which has been attached to an Ion Reactor that builds up an immense charge, resulting in the strongest weapon known to exist.
EquipmentDescriptions[0][4]=The Photon Disruptor is a relatively weak weapon, but has the ability to disable an opponent's electrical systems, rendering them helpless.
EquipmentDescriptions[0][5]=The Quantum Disruptor is a very powerful disabling weapon. Once an opponent's sheilds are down it will usually require only a single shot with the Quantum Disruptor to disable them.
EquipmentDescriptions[1][0]=The Energy Shield is a very basic deflector shield. Its operating principle is to absorb the energy directed at it.
EquipmentDescriptions[1][1]=The Reflective Shield is twice as powerful as the Energy Shield. It works by reflecting the energy directed at it instead of absorbing that energy.
EquipmentDescriptions[1][2]=The Lightning Shield is the most powerful shield known to exist. It features a Reflective Shield operating on a rotating frequency, which causes what looks like lightning to play across the shield barrier.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][0]=Extra Cargo Bays to store anything your ship can take on as cargo.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][1]=The Auto-Repair System works to reduce the damage your ship sustains in battle, and repairs some damage in between encounters. It also boosts all other engineering functions.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][2]=The Navigating System increases the overall Pilot skill of the ship, making it harder to hit in battle, and making it easier to flee an encounter.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][3]=The Targeting System increases the overall Fighter skill of the ship, which increases the amount of damage done to an opponent in battle.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][4]=The Cloaking Device can enable your ship to evade detection by an opponent, but only if the Engineer skill of your ship is greater than that of your opponent. It also makes your ship harder to hit in battle.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][5]=The Fuel Compactor that you got as a reward for warning Gemulon of the invasion will increase the range of your ship by 3 parsecs.
EquipmentDescriptions[2][6]=These extra bays will not be detected during routine police searches. They may be detected if you are arrested and the police perform a more thorough search.

QuestPhaseMessages[0]=This alien artifact should be delivered to professor Berger, who is currently traveling. You can probably find him at a hi-tech solar system. The alien race which produced this artifact seems keen on getting it back, however, and may hinder the carrier. Are you, for a price, willing to deliver it?
QuestPhaseMessages[1]=This is professor Berger. I thank you for delivering the alien artifact to me. I hope the aliens weren't too much of a nuisance. I have transferred 20000 credits to your account, which I assume compensates for your troubles.
QuestPhaseMessages[2]=A trader in second-hand goods offers you 3 sealed cargo canisters for the sum of 1000 credits. It could be a good deal: they could contain robots. Then again, it might just be water. Do you want the canisters?
QuestPhaseMessages[3]=This is Colonel Jackson of the Space Corps. An experimental ship, code-named "Dragonfly", has been stolen. It is equipped with very special, almost indestructible shields. It shouldn't fall into the wrong hands and we will reward you if you destroy it. It has been last seen in the Baratas system.
QuestPhaseMessages[4]=A small ship of a weird design docked here recently for repairs. The engineer who worked on it said that it had a weak hull, but incredibly strong shields. I heard it took off in the direction of the Melina system.
QuestPhaseMessages[5]=Hello, Commander. This is Colonel Jackson again. On behalf of the Space Corps, I thank you for your valuable assistance in destroying the Dragonfly. As a reward, we will install one of the experimental shields on your ship. Return here for that when you're ready.
QuestPhaseMessages[6]=A ship with shields that seemed to be like lightning recently fought many other ships in our system. I have never seen anything like it before. After it left, I heard it went to the Regulas system.
QuestPhaseMessages[7]=A small ship with shields like I have never seen before was here a few days ago. It destroyed at least ten police ships! Last thing I heard was that it went to the Zalkon system.
QuestPhaseMessages[8]=Colonel Jackson here. Do you want us to install a lightning shield on your current ship?
QuestPhaseMessages[9]=A hacker conveys to you that he has cracked the passwords to the galaxy-wide police computer network, and that he can erase your police record for the sum of 5000 credits. Do you want him to do that?
QuestPhaseMessages[10]=While reviewing the plans for Dr. Fehler's new space-warping drive, Dr. Lowenstam discovered a critical error. If you don't go to Daled and stop the experiment within ten days, the time-space continuum itself could be damaged!
QuestPhaseMessages[11]=Dr. Fehler can't understand why the experiment failed. But the failure has had a dramatic and disastrous effect on the fabric of space-time itself. It seems that Dr. Fehler won't be getting tenure any time soon... and you may have trouble when you warp!
QuestPhaseMessages[12]=Upon your warning, Dr. Fehler calls off the experiment. As your  reward, you are given a Portable Singularity. This device will, for one time only, instantaneously transport you to any system in the galaxy. The Singularity can be accessed  by clicking the "J" (Jump) button on the Galactic Chart.
QuestPhaseMessages[13]=We received word that aliens will invade Gemulon seven days from now. We know exactly at which coordinates they will arrive, but we can't warn Gemulon because an ion storm disturbs all forms of communication. We need someone, anyone, to deliver this info to Gemulon within six days.
QuestPhaseMessages[14]=Do you wish us to install the fuel compactor on your current ship? (You need a free gadget slot)
QuestPhaseMessages[15]=Alas, Gemulon has been invaded by aliens, which has thrown us back to pre-agricultural times. If only we had known the exact coordinates where they first arrived at our system, we might have prevented this tragedy from happening.
QuestPhaseMessages[16]=This information of the arrival of the alien invasion force allows us to prepare a defense. You have saved our way of life. As a reward, we have a fuel compactor gadget for you, which will increase the travel distance by 3 parsecs for any ship. Return here to get it installed.
QuestPhaseMessages[17]=A strange disease has invaded the Japori system. We would like you to deliver these ten canisters of special antidote to Japori. Note that, if you accept, ten of your cargo bays will remain in use on your way to Japori. Do you accept this mission?
QuestPhaseMessages[18]=Thank you for delivering the medicine to us. We don't have any money to reward you, but we do have an alien fast-learning machine with which we will increase your skills.
QuestPhaseMessages[19]=There is a small but habitable moon for sale in the Utopia system, for the very reasonable sum of half a million credits. If you accept it, you can retire to it and live a peaceful, happy, and wealthy life. Do you wish to buy it?
QuestPhaseMessages[20]=Welcome to the Utopia system. Your own moon is available for you to retire to it, if you feel inclined to do that. Are you ready to retire and lead a happy, peaceful, and wealthy life?
QuestPhaseMessages[21]=Captain Renwick developed a new organic hull material for his ship which cannot be damaged except by Pulse lasers. While he was celebrating this success, pirates boarded and stole the craft, which they have named the Scarab. Rumors suggest it's being hidden at the exit to a wormhole. Destroy the ship for a reward!
QuestPhaseMessages[22]=Space Corps is indebted to you for destroying the Scarab and the pirates who stole it. As a reward, we can have Captain Renwick upgrade the hull of your ship. Note that his upgrades won't be transferable if you buy a new ship! Come back with the ship you wish to upgrade.
QuestPhaseMessages[23]=The organic hull used in the Scarab is still not ready for day-to-day use. But Captain Renwick can certainly upgrade your hull with some of his retrofit technology. It's light stuff, and won't reduce your ship's range. Should he upgrade your ship?
QuestPhaseMessages[24]=An alien with a fast-learning machine offers to increase one of your skills for the reasonable sum of 3000 credits. You won't be able to pick that skill, though. Do you accept his offer?
QuestPhaseMessages[25]=A space monster has invaded the Acamar system and is disturbing the trade routes. You'll be rewarded handsomely if you manage to destroy it.
QuestPhaseMessages[26]=We thank you for destroying the space monster that circled our system for so long. Please accept 15000 credits as reward for your heroic deed.
QuestPhaseMessages[27]=A merchant prince offers you a very special and wondrous item for the sum of 1000 credits. Do you accept?
QuestPhaseMessages[28]=An eccentric alien billionaire wants to buy your collection of tribbles and offers half a credit for each of them. Do you accept his offer?
