Worse, it's not stable -- its resonant energy will weaken your shields and hull strength while it's aboard your ship. Are you willing to deliver it?",

While he was celebrating this success, pirates boarded and stole the craft, which they have named the Scarab. Rumors suggest it's being hidden at the exit to a wormhole. Destroy the ship for a reward!",

            "The organic hull used in the Scarab is still not ready for day-to-day use. But Captain Renwick can certainly upgrade your hull with some of his retrofit technology. It's light stuff, and won't reduce your ship's range. Should he upgrade your ship?",

However, I have something better for you. I have an acquaintance who can install hidden compartments in your ship.\" Return with an empty gadget slot when you're ready to have it installed.",

Please rescue her! (You'll need to equip your ship with disruptors to be able to defeat the Scorpion without destroying it.) A ship bristling with weapons was blasting out of the system. It's trajectory before going to warp indicates that its destination was Centauri.",
